## Entrance to the Second Level: Alberic's Study

Upon entering Alberic's study, the adventurers find a room filled with notes, books, and brewing paraphernalia, all signs of a master brewer at work. However, what immediately draws the eye is the back of the room, where a heavy wooden door has been barricaded with furniture, crates, and anything else Alberic could find. Scratches and dents mar the surface of the door and its surroundings, suggesting that whatever is on the other side was determined to get through.

The barricade, while sturdy, shows signs of recent construction, hinting that Alberic's attempts to seal off the lower levels were a last-minute effort to contain a sudden threat. A sense of foreboding fills the air, as the barricade serves as a silent testament to the dangers that lie beyond.

As the party approaches, they can see that the barricade is not insurmountable. With some effort, they can clear a path to the door. However, the real question remains: what compelled Alberic to take such drastic measures, and what awaits them in the brewery's depths?

## Alberic's Journal
<details>
<summary>Journal Entry</summary>

Alberic's journal details his quest for brewing the perfect beer, with particular focus on the `Lunarbloom Mystic Hop` found in the Enchanted Forest. His notes describe various experiments, one of which shows promise with a unique blend that enhances magical abilities for a short period.

**Last Entry:**
"What have I done? This last experiment has gone too far and needs to be stopped. The barrels are coming alive, taking on a life of their own! The bottling machine has become sentient and is wreaking havoc. This evil must be stopped before it escapes the brewery!"
