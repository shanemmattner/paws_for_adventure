<summary><span style="font-size:20px;">The Laughing Beholder</span></summary>

You've all gathered at `The Laughing Beholder` under the banner of `Globetrotter Guilds, Inc.`, a company that recruits and deploys fresh talent for a variety of quests across the land.  Each of you has just graduated from your respective academies and find yourselves excited for some real-world adventure! The party is there to talk with the owner `Borin Deepkeg` about their first assignment.

Borin first offers them a beer from the large selection he has available.

Then Borin tells the about his concern for his dear friend `Alberic` who has stopped delivering his prized ale and hasn't been heard from in months. A local businessman went to check on Alberic recently and also hasn't returned.  

The party's task is to investigate the brewery, discover the fate of Alberic and the tavern employee, and secure the future of the ale's delivery.

`Secondary Objective`: Borin, with a more secretive tone, mentions that if the adventurers stumble upon the recipe for Alberic's Arcane Ale, he's willing to offer an additional `10,000 gold` pieces for its retrieval. However, he stresses this part of the mission must remain between them, as Globetrotter Guilds, Inc. would not condone the appropriation of such valuable intellectual property.

The characters must travel thru the enchanted forest a one day trek to get to Alberic's brewery.

### Beer selection at The Laughing Beholder
- Alberic's brewery is called `Alberic's Arcane Ales`
    - known for `Hopspell Havoc IPA`: seems to make people more aware but gives a firefly hangover the next day
        - `Brewer's Boon`: For the next hour, they gain an enhanced sense of perception, granting them the ability to detect hidden doors, traps, and illusions within a 15-foot radius. Additionally, this boon gives a +1 bonus to AC (Armor Class), as the drinker's heightened senses allow them to react more swiftly to threats. However, due to the potent magic infused within the hops, those who partake may also experience vivid, hop-filled dreams the next time they sleep, providing insights or cryptic messages from the brew itself.
        - `Magical Hangover`: The next day, the character suffers from a magical hangover, experiencing disorienting flashes of arcane energy that obscure their vision. They have disadvantage on Perception checks and cannot benefit from the Brewer's Boon for 24 hours.
